before next release
-------------------
* test CSS with IE
* clean up documentation
* go over all FIXMEs in code
* for basename matching: ignore case
* remove whats from whats*.py plugins

probably before 2.0 release
---------------------------
* rewrite html parsing code with newer libraries and detect more tags
* parse css
* maybe choose a different license for webcheck.css
* make it possible to copy or reference webcheck.css
* make it possible to copy http:.../webcheck.css into place (use scheme system)
* create onmouseover information for linkgs containing useful information for url
* make more things configurable
* make a Debian package
* maybe generate a list of page children and page parents (combining embedded links and following redirects) (this is useful to list proper parent links for problem pages and helps generate the sitemap)
* figure out if we need parents and pageparents
* configurable time-out when retrieving a document
* support for mult-threading (maybe)
* divide problems in transfer problems and page problems (transfer problems result in a bad link problem on a page)
* clean up printing of messages, especially needed for multi-threading
* rewrite scheme modules to make proper use of new calling method
* only download complete documents if the mime type is supported
* rewrite http module with newer libraries
* rewrite ftp module to be more robust
* go over command line options and see if we need long equivalents

wishlist
--------
* make code for stripping last part of a url (e.g. foo/index.html -> foo/)
* translate file paths to file:/// urls on the command line
* maybe set referer (configurable)
* maybe created a no-author specified error plugin
* support for authenticating proxies
* new config file format (if we want a configfile at all)
* cookies support (maybe)
* integration with weblint
* combine with a logfile checker to also show number of hits per link
* performance and other improvements (we can switch to sets with python 2.4)
* make linking to a permanent redirect (301) a problem

new/unsorted
------------
* remove email addresses from copyrights notices
* write section on internal and external urls in the manual page
* fix misc TODOs and FIXMEs in the source
* maybe find a new name as there are a lot of webchecks out there
