This is webcheck, a command line utility for crawling websites.

webcheck was originally named linbot which was developed by Albert
Hopkins (marduk) <marduk@python.net>.

Versions up till 1.0 were maintained by Mike W. Meyer <mwm@mired.org> who
changed the name to webcheck, http://www.mired.org/webcheck/.

After that Arthur de Jong <arthur@ch.tudelft.nl> took up the work and did
a complete rewrite, http://ch.tudelft.nl/~arthur/webcheck/.

Arthur de Jong is both the upstream and Debian package maintainer, so
there are no differences between the Debian package and the upstream
version.

The Debian package of webcheck was previously maintained by Bastian Kleineidam
<calvin@debian.org>. The Debian package of linbot was maintained by Colin
Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>, Matej Vela <vela@debian.org> and Jean Pierre
LeJacq <jplejacq@quoininc.com>.
