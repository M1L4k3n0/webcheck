webcheck (1.9.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * initial (re)release of webcheck Debian package (closes: #326429)
  * this release should fix all open bugs on the time of the former webcheck
    page removal, except wishlist bugs #71419 (i18n) and #271085 (html
    validation), anyone interested can refile those bugs (preferably with
    patches or some pointers on how to implemement the changes)
  * /etc/webcheck is completely removed on upgrades since a site wide
    configuration file is no longer supported (webcheck is a user level tool
    that should not be configured site wide)

linbot (1.0.0-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Python 2.2 has nested scopes on by default and warns about using 'from

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon,  2 Sep 2002 00:48:40 +0100

    document rather than the confusing "Malformed URL?" (closes: #134620).

    obsolete regsub and regex modules.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Jan 2002 17:30:33 +0000

linbot (1.0.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * myUrlLib.py: Import socket so linbot doesn't crash on non-existent URLs
    (closes: #122900).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Dec 2001 11:37:05 +0000

  * New maintainer (closes: #106562). Thanks to Matej Vela in particular for
    doing excellent QA work on linbot.
  * myUrlLib.py: Rename a local variable from 'string' to 'dstring' to avoid
    clashing with the string module (closes: #121763).

  * NMU
  * Use python2.1.

linbot (1.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release early, release often. ;)
  * schemes/ftplink.py: Mostly fixed up.  It now correctly parses URLs
    (see RFC 1738), honors the specified port, handles exceptions from
    FTP.size, closes the connection cleanly, and is actually able to
    retrieve files.  My request for further information bounced, but I
    believe this closes: #45763.
  * linbot.py: Generate relative references to images, using symlinks
    if necessary.  Closes: #75727.

 -- Matej Vela <vela@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Aug 2001 17:09:11 +0200

linbot (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version.  As suggested by Gregor Hoffleit, using
    1.0.0 instead of 1.0 to avoid adding an epoch.  Closes: #41080.
  * Package is orphaned; maintainer set to Debian QA Group.  Bugs
    fixed by NMUs can be closed.  Closes: #41345, #45225, #46526.
  * linbot.gif is already included in the package.  Closes: #54861.
  * The upstream site is down indefinitely:
    * config.py: Set WARN_OLD_VERSION to false.
    * debian/copyright: Refer to metalab.  Closes: #54862, #77290.
    * debian/index.html: Left out until it's thoroughly updated.
  * linbot.py: Don't overwrite config.HOSTS.  Closes: #68719.
  * config.py: Applied Kevin Dalley's patch to fix typos in the
    YANKED_URLS example.  Closes: #69899.
  * schemes/httplink.py: Applied Francesco Potorti's patch to reset
    redirect_depth when done with redirections.  Closes: #104408.
  * Converted to debhelper.  The old build system is just too hairy.
  * Restoring upstream layout, moved linbot.py and symlinked config.py
    to .../site-packages/linbot.  Also, since Python prepends the
    script directory to sys.path *after* resolving symlinks, replaced
    the wrapper with a `/usr/bin/linbot -> .../linbot.py' symlink.
  * Conforms to Standards version 3.5.6:
    * Added build dependencies.
    * Conforms to the FHS.  It's worth noting that /usr/lib/linbot has
      been moved to /usr/share/linbot.  Closes: #54860.
    * debian/copyright: Updated reference to GPL.
