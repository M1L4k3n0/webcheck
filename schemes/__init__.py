"""This package groups all the supported schemes.

A scheme module can be requested by the get_schememodule() function.
Each module should export the following function:

    fetch(link, acceptedtypes)
        Fetch the link. Some basic information about the document is
        provided if possible (size, mimetype, mtime, status in case of
        errors, etc). Also the contents of the link is fetched and
        returned if the content type is mentioned in the acceptedtypes
        list."""
