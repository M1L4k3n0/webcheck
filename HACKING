WEBCHECK DESIGN OVERVIEW
========================

Webcheck has grown and has been refactored over time. While some different
design concepts were used, recently there has been a push towards a modular
plugin-based design.

The graphs blowe should give an overview of the modules and order of calling
the functions.
