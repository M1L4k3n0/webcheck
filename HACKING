WEBCHECK DESIGN OVERVIEW
========================

Webcheck has grown and has been refactored over time so there is not really a
single design. The functions are grouped in modules according to their
function. This graphs should present a simple overview of the modules and
order of calling the functions.

webcheck/                   - top-level namespace
 \- cmd.py                  - main program entry point, command line parsing, etc
 \- config.py               - configuration settings (imported from most other
 |                            modules)
 \- util.py                 - common functions imported from most other modules
 |
 \- crawler.py              - module with loop and logic for traversing a
 |   |                        website and storing all the information about
 |   |                        the website that is used later
 \- myurllib.py             - module for ftp/file/http url fetching
 |
 \- parsers/__init__.py     - front-end module to handle parsing of content
 |  \- html/                - parser modules for html content
 |  \- css.py               - parser module for css (dummy currently)
 |
 \- plugins/__init__.py     - front-end module for plugin modules, this calls
     |                        all configured plugins and has some helper
     |                        functions for plugins
     \- plugins/*.py        - per report one plugin that does some specific
                              checking and outputs some html code
