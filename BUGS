Known bugs:

I tried webcheck on a site that used FrontPage publishing on IIS and
IIS reports error 406 whenever webcheck attemts to retieve the HEADers
for a document in one of the "underscore" directories.  I'm not yet
sure why this happens, but I doubt its really webcheck's fault.  I
might just have to code a way around it. In the meantime, you can
usually yank these URLs with -y '/_' or something similiar.

Some (IIS?) servers seem to be reporting -1 as an HTTP status code.
I'm not sure what that means or what to do about it.
